Parts:
- 16 awg enamel copper wire, I bought from Emtel, was 500g for 200kr. Is enough for many projects. 
- pi pico rp2040 - 40kr, buy Pico H if you don't want to solder headers yourself.
- 32 switches - 64kr, KTT makes very nice cheap switches.
- 32 keycaps - can go from very cheap to 4x price of the rest of the parts depending on what you go with.
